        The difference between Kidney FAQ and other AI tools, such as ChatGPT, is that Kidney FAQ is focused on kidney disease exclusively.  ChatGPT and other general purpose AI tools are more general in nature and try to be everything to everybody.   Kidney FAQ does have some general knowledge. You can ask it some basic questions, but it doesn‚Äôt attempt to compete with other types of AI tools, so you may be disappointed with the results.   ChatGPT is trained (they claim) on the whole internet so its knowledge base is vast, but how can be sure of where its answers are generated from.
